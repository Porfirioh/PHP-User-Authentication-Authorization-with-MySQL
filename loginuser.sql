Before Indian independence, the college was affiliated with University of Punjab and post independence Banaras Hindu University gave affiliation to S.P. college until the University of Kashmir was founded in 1956.[6] It was established in 1905, as an intermediate college by upgrading the famous Hindu High School, Srinagar. It was the personal effort of notable British Social Reformer and educationist, Annie Besant who directed the Central Hindu College Trust, Banaras(to which it was affiliated) to appoint, Mr M.U. Moore, a noted Irish Scholar as the first Principal of the institution. Beginning with a modest roll of eight students and only six teachers on its staff, in a few years'' time, the college rose to the degree level in Arts by 1911 when state govt. took it over and renamed it as Sri Pratap College after the name of the then ruler of the state Maharaja Pratap Singh. In 1912 the college was affiliated to the University of Punjab, Lahore with the state patronage available to it by virtue of which the growth of S.P College received a notable fillip. Ever since, the development of the college has been a steady process through the entire span of the 20th Century.\r\n\r\nDuring the tenure of Prof. I.K Sharga (1911-1921) the science stream up to intermediate level was introduced in the college curriculum.[4] The dynamic and ablest academics and administrators like Prof. M.U. Moore, Prof. Vinamali Chakaravati, Prof. I.K. Sharga, Prof. Lawrence Mac Dermot, Prof. M.M. Ibrahim, Dr. M. D. Taseer , Prof. Jia Lal Kaul and Prof. Saif ud Din have served the college and contributed to the level that the hundreds of the college alumni rose to eminence in different fields of human activity in the state and outside, by occupying important positions.[7][8]\r\n\r\nThe college has celebrated its centenary year in 2005, and in this year people from the world participated in the college function, as the different departments of the college organized different workshops and exhibitions.\r\n\r\nThe history of S.P College is, in-fact, the history of progress of higher education in Kashmir. Almost for the first half of the 20th Century, S.P. College had the distinction of being the only institution to provide facilities for imparting higher education in Arts and Sciences in the valley. Despite a good number of colleges coming into existence in the valley after 1947, this college continues to maintain its primacy and academic excellence all along. With the delinking of arts faculty from it in 1975, S.P. College is now an exclusively science college imparting science education at Undergraduate level in a broad spectrum of subjects like English, Chemistry, Botany, Zoology, Environment and Water Management, Biochemistry, Clinical Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Bioinformatics, Human Genetics, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Geology, Geography, Electronics, Information Technology. The college also offers add-on course in Spoken Arabic, Environmental Sciences, Communicative English, Personality Development, Physical Education, Diagnostic Lab Technology etc. The college also offers Postgraduate level programmes in various science subjects.[9][10]\r\n\r\nThe institute has been declared as a part of the cluster university of Srinagar under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan.[11] The institute shall run School of Sciences under this initiative offering more postgraduate as well as research intensive programes.[12] With operationalization of the school of Sciences under RUSA cluster University proposal, research is expected to get a flip with more funding coming for the purpose. The infrastructure for this project is being funded by Central Government and is coming-up at brisk pace. The school is likely to start from 2017.[12]\r\n\r\nIt is worth to mention that the college got submerged in the September 2014 deluge.

It was established in 1937, long before the birth of the state of Kerala in India, by a promulgation of the Maharajah of Travancore, Sri Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma who was also the first Chancellor of the university. C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, the then Diwan (Prime Minister) of Travancore, was the first Vice-Chancellor.', 'http://www.keralauniversity.ac.in/', 'One of the first 16 Universities in India and the first in the state of Kerala, the University of Kerala was founded as the University of Travancore in the erstwhile princely state of Travancore (now southern part of Kerala and some neighboring parts of state of Tamil Nadu) in 1937. During the 7 decades since the University of Kerala grew and shrunk physically and transformed itself in many ways.\r\n\r\nThe earliest origins of the University may be traced back to two institutions of modern learning in Kerala, the University College, Thiruvananthapuram and the Trivandrum Observatory. The University College was initially founded as the Maharaja''s Free School by Maharaja Swathi Thirunal in 1834, with Mr John Roberts. A Christian Missionary as Headmaster, and soon grew into a college in 1866, affiliated to the Madras University. When the University of Travancore was founded, the Departments of the college became the University Departments, only to switch back again when the transformation to University of Kerala happened in 1957. The University College still retains its connection with the University as an affiliated college. The Trivandrum Observatory was founded in 1838 and had an internationally reputed scientist, John Caldecott FRS as its first Director. It became a part of the Travancore University, but for some time was administered as an independent government institution. It is now the oldest institution under the Kerala University.\r\n\r\nThe University of Travancore was established in 1937 by a promulgation of the Maharajah of Travancore, Sri Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma who was also the first Chancellor of the University. Sir C. P Ramaswamy Ayyar, the then Diwan (Prime minister) of the State was the first Vice-Chancellor. He was an eminent scholar and an able administrator. It is said the Government made an unsuccessful attempt to invite Albert Einstein to be the first Vice-Chancellor. The University was modelled after the best Universities of the United Kingdom, and even today retains some of these features. The affiliating system of the University however evolved to be different from the college system in British Universities.\r\n\r\nOnly ten colleges within the State of Travancore, which were at that time affiliated to the Madras University, became the affiliated colleges of the University of Travancore. In 1954, the unified state of Kerala came into being with most of Travancore and whole of state of Cochin and Malabar area of Madras presidency becoming part of it. The Kerala University Act (Act 14 of 1957) was brought into force and the University of Travancore was renamed University of Kerala. The University had three campuses located in three different parts of the State viz. Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode. The number of affiliated colleges grew phenomenally. However, in 1968, the University Centre at Kozhikode became a full-fledged University, the University of Calicut, affiliating the colleges located in Thrissur, Palakkad, Kozhikode and Kannur districts of Kerala and transforming the Kozhikkode Centre into University Departments. The Cochin University of Science and Technology - CUSAT -(1971), Kerala Agricultural University (1971) and Mahatma Gandhi University (1983) were subsequently established, with CUSAT taking over the University''s centre at Cochin. These developments have shrunk the jurisdiction of the University of Kerala to Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha Districts and some parts of Pathanamthitta District.\r\n\r\nDepartments[edit]\r\nAt present, the University has sixteen faculties and forty one departments of teaching and research in addition to study centres and other departments. Teaching, Research and Knowledge extension are the mandate of the Departments. They primarily focus on post-graduate (masters) programmes, MPhil programmes (1-year research degree) and doctoral research. In 2007, the University awarded over 100 PhDs. (University''s research activities are also going on in select affiliated colleges and other recognised research centres in and outside the state). The University has had in its faculties eminent scholars who were trained under legendary figures (Sir C V Raman''s student in Dept of Physics, Prof S R Ranganathan''s student in Library Science and Prof Benjamin Bloom''s student in Dept of Education). Some of the faculty members themselves were legends, such as famous poet K Ayyappa Panciker, Oriental scholar T Ganapathi Sasthri etc. The total number of full-time students in the University Departments is above 2000 including research students and a modest number of foreign students. The Institute of Distance Education offers a number of under-graduate and post graduate programmes which cater to more than 7000 students, all over the country and abroad.\r\n\r\nStudy Centres[edit]\r\nThe University has also a number of study centres in specialised areas such as Nano-technology, Kerala Studies, Bioinformatics, Women''s Studies, Learning Difficulties, Sree Narayana Studies, Gandhian Studies etc. Some of these centres have taught programmes (Certificate/Diploma/Masters/Mphil) and many offer PhD programmes. The University has also established 10 University College of Teacher Education (UTEC) and 8 University Institute of Technologies (UIT) both of which offer under-graduate programmes (BEd in UTECs and BSc Computer Science/IT, Electronics/BBA in UITs), although masters programmes are available in select UITs. The University College of Engineering at Karyavattom offers Engineering Education at Undergraduate level. These institutions together have student strength of more than 5000.\r\n\r\nAffiliated Colleges[edit]\r\nMain article: List of colleges affiliated to Kerala University\r\nThe University has over 150 affiliated colleges. The role of the University is in prescribing courses of study and conducting examinations and issuing certificates. The day-to-day administration of these institutions is not under the purview of the University. However, these institutions form a major part of the University. Of these 60 are Arts and Science colleges. There are 2 Law colleges, 17 Engineering Colleges, 9 MBA/MCA Colleges, 37 Teacher Training Colleges, 4 Medical Colleges, 4 Ayurveda colleges, 2 Homeopathy Colleges, one Siddha Medical College, 3 Dental colleges, 10 Nursing Colleges, 4 Pharmacy Colleges, 2 Fine Arts Colleges, and a Music College. The University also has a National College of Physical Education affiliated to it. The total number of students in these colleges crosses 84,000.');

In 1964 Belonia College was launched in South Tripura, followed within three years by the establishment of Ram Thakur College in 1967 at Agartala. The students of the state remained hamstrung by one crucial fact: all of the colleges had to secure affiliation with Calcutta University and no scope for university education existed within Tripura.\r\n\r\nSince the late 1960s CE, student movements within Tripura consistently focused on the demand for expansion of opportunities for higher education and setting of Tripura’s own university. Responding to rising demands Calcutta University authority agreed to have post-graduate classes on history, mathematics, and economics held in MBB College and, in 1976, the University Grants Commission (UGC) recognized this as Calcutta University Post Graduate Centre (CUPGC). This only further intensified the state’s quest for higher education and demand for a separate university . It however took nine more years to initiate measures for setting up Tripura’s own university. It was on May 18, 1985 that the then education minister and tribal leader Dasharath Deb laid the foundation for Tripura University on the sprawling 75 acres (300,000 m2) of land, donated by the state government, at Suryamaninagar, ten kilometers south of Agartala. The work on construction progressed rapidly and the state assembly passed the Tripura University Act in 1987, extending legislative approval to the process of launching the University.

This public petition, which was presented by the Advocate General Mr. George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English college in the city of Madras. Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a central collegiate institution or a ‘university.’ This university had twin departments – a high school for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, and a college for instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.\r\n\r\nThe University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its President. This was the precursor of the present Presidency College, Chennai. A systematic educational policy for India was formulated 14 years later by Wood''s despatch, which pointed out the rationale for "creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University." The Dispatch recommended the establishment in the universities of Professorships "for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages." As a result, the University of Madras, organized on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an Act of the Legislative Council of India.\r\n\r\nThe university progressed and expanded through the 19th century to span the whole of South India, giving birth to universities like Mysore University (1916), Osmania University (1918), Andhra University (1926), Annamalai University (1929), Travancore University (1937) presently University of Kerala, Sri Venkateswara University (1954), Madurai Kamaraj University (1966), Bharathidasan University (1982), Bharathiar University (1982), Manonmaniam Sundaranar University (1990), Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (1971), Anna University (1978), Tamil University (1981), Mother Teresa Women''s University (1984), Dr. M.G.R. Medical University (1989), Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (1989), Periyar University (1997) and Dr. Ambedkar Law University (1996).\r\n\r\nIn 1912 endowments were made to the university to establish departments of Indian History, Archaeology, Comparative Philology and Indian Economics. In that year the university had 17 departments, 30 teachers, and 69 research scholars. Later the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by the Sadler Commission and the gains of the University were consolidated by the enactment of the Madras University Act of 1923. About this time, the territorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from Berhampur of Orissa in the North East, Trivandrum of Kerala in the South West, Bangalore and Mangalore of Karnataka in the West and Hyderabad of Andhra Pradesh in the North.\r\n\r\nBetween 1926 and 1939, the university published the comprehensive Tamil Lexicon dictionary, which is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language.[6]\r\n\r\nCoat of arms[edit]\r\nThe description of the Coat of Arms of the university, designed in 1857, is:\r\n\r\n"Argent (silver or white) on a Mount issuant from the basement a Tiger passant proper (walking and coloured naturally), on a Chief Sable (black across the top), a Pale Or (a gold or yellow vertical strip down the centre 1/3 of the top or chief), thereon, between two Elephants heads couped of the field, a lotus flower leaved and slipped of the third, together with this motto Doctrina Vim Promovet Insitam".\r\n\r\nThe coat of arms colours are: the base is light green, the tiger is yellow on a white background, the elephant is grey on a black background, the lotus is a white flower with olive green leaves, on a gold background. The motto scroll is edged red, with black lettering. The English translation of the motto of the University of Madras is: "Learning promotes natural talent."'),
